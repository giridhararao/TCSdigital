Frank is conducting an online graphics course, where he will be giving a value of n, and expecting each of his k students to submit a different triangulation with no intersections. To help him, he asks his TCS friend to create a JAR (Java library) for him to compute the number of ways of triangulating a polygon, given n. This JAR implements the function PolygonTriangulateApi.noTriang, which accepts an integer parameter n, and returns an integer giving the number of ways of triangulating the n sided polygon.

Frank would like you to code a program in JAVA to get the value of k, and output the smallest value of n that would enable each of his students to submit a different triangulation. With k=12, the value of n is obviously 6.

    int k=0;
    sideCount=0;
    for(int side=3;;side++){
    k=PolygonTrangulateApi.noTriang(side);
    if(k>=stuCount){
